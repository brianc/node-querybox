# querybox [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-querybox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-querybox)

A little helper to read a directory full of `.sql` files and execute them

## install

```bash
$ npm install querybox
```

## use

```js
var pgQuery = require('pg-query')
var querybox = require('querybox')

var pathToQueriesDirectory = __dirname + '/queries'

//expect the /queries folder structure to look like this:
// - queries/get-user.sql
// - queries/get-photos.sql

var box = querybox(pathToQueriesDirectory, pgQuery)


//get a query by name
console.log(box.get('get-user')) //the contents of the queries/get-user.sql file

console.log(box.get('blaaaa')) //false

//gets the query text from the file
//then passes the text, parameters, and the callback
//to whatever supplied query function you've given
box.run('get-user', [userId], function(err, rows) {
  console.log(rows[0].name) //brian
})

```
